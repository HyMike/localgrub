Food Delivery Platform

Goal:
Enable customers to order food, notify restaurants, assign drivers, track deliveries, and manage payments‚Äîall through asynchronous, event-driven microservices.




Data flow Diagram: 


1. Customer orders food from menu item and checkout with credit card information. The frontend makes a API call to the backend order service.
2. Order service takes customer order information and stores it in the database: Customer information that sent to the order service is: uid, firstName,lastName, email, itemId, itemName, quantity, price, creditCardInfo, createdAt
3. Order Service as a producer will emit to RabbitMQ a order_placed router key. The exchange using a topic method will have consumer that will listen to this thru it's specific topic queue for binding key: order_placed.
4. Order_placed will be consume by multiple microservices (payment service,restaurant service and notification service). Payment Service will consume the message and charge their customer. Notification service will take order_placed message and send out a confirmation email to the customer.
5. Restaurant Service will make an API call to its database upon consuming the order_placed message to check if there is enought incredients to make the menu items the customer order. A boolean is return stating if enough items are available or not.
6. Order_prepared message is emited from restaurant service to the exchange letting order service know to update the order service database for that order as pending.
7. Notification service also consume order_prepared message and send out a email to customer that their is preparing and ready to pick up at a certain time.
8. The restaurant chef has an order managment page. It allows them to access all orders. When the chef marks the order as completed. An API POST request is sent to the order service to mark the order has been completed.
9. Order service makes an API call to its database to update the status of the order to completed.
10. A order_ready is emited to the exchange.
11. Notification Service send out a email to customer letting them know that their order is ready for pickup. 


1. Customer submits order in the frontend
2. Frontend sends API request to the backend (order service) which inserts the order info into a DB and publishes a message to the order.received topic in rabbitmq
3. Restaurant service looks at the order to determine if you have enough of the required ingredients to make this dish. (let's assume yes) Restaurant service prepares the meal and publishes a message order.preparing.
4. The order stays in this state until the chef says the order is ready. At which point he clicks a button in the UI and makes a PUT api request to order service to update the status as "ready" and publish a new message "order.ready"
5. At this point, you can choose to continue the flow and have the user eat their meal and then try to submit a payment after. or you could move payments up in the flow if this is like a food truck or casual dining place where you pay first and then go pick up your food. It depends on what you wanna do.
6. OPTIONAL: At each point of this flow, you can have a NotificationService, that is listening to every message that is being published and sending out notifications to the user about their order. This is where you could really highlight how your system has multiple consumers listening to the same messages and really show off the power of a pub sub pattern.
